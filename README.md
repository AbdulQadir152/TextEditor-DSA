# 📝 Mini Text Editor in C++

A **Data Structures & Algorithms-based** text editor built in C++ that supports insertion, deletion, updating, and file operations on a line-by-line text buffer — along with **undo** and **redo** functionality using the Command design pattern.

## 🚀 Features

- Add, update, or delete lines at any position
- Save buffer to a text file
- Load buffer from a text file
- Undo and redo any modification (via Command Pattern)
- Displays all lines with line numbers
- Command-line interface for interaction

## 💡 Concepts Used

- **Doubly Linked List** – Core data structure to manage the text buffer
- **Command Design Pattern** – For implementing undo/redo functionality
- **Stacks (Custom Template)** – Used for managing undo and redo history
- **File I/O** – Load from and save to external `.txt` files
